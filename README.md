## What about if I want to run just in my computer?

Ok, we can do it. But, first you need the backend part. Because this is only the front-end part.

### Cloning the back-end

- You need to clone the back-end part (you can find him [here](https://github.com/MVCGCorp/PG-Backend)) and follow their steps to run it.

- If you do all steps in the correct way now you can go to the localhost:3001 and check it. You can see something like this:

### Preparing the front-end

To the run the front-end part you need to follow these steps:

- First you need to clone this repository

- Go to the frontend folder and run -> npm install <- command

- After that you need to go the frontend/src/redux/actions/:name and change every axios method line with the localhost:3001 in all of the :nameAction.js files.
